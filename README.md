## üèõÔ∏è Architecture & Development Process

We utilised bolt.new to create the base of our app. We supplemented this with use of the **HULA Framework** for prompt engineering. Our goal was to create a robust, scalable application using Supabase.

This systematic approach allowed for rapid development while ensuring the final product was well-architected and aligned with our vision.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js & npm
-   Supabase Account & CLI (`npm install -g supabase`)
-   Vercel Account
-   Google Cloud Project with OAuth 2.0 credentials
-   OpenAI API Key
-   Comet Opik API Key

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone ** replace **
    cd inbox-intel
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase locally:**
    ```bash
    supabase init
    supabase start
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the `inbox-intel` directory and populate it with your keys from Supabase, Google, OpenAI, and Comet Opik.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Deployment

This project uses a hybrid deployment model:

1.  **Frontend & Database:** The Next.js frontend is deployed to Vercel.
2.  **Backend Logic:** Supabase Edge Functions are deployed from the local machine using the Supabase CLI:
    ```bash
    supabase functions deploy --project-ref <your-project-ref>
    ```

This process ensures a CI/CD-like workflow for the frontend while allowing direct deployment of the serverless backend functions.
